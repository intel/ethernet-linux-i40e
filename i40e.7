.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
This driver supports Linux* kernel versions 2.6.32 and newer. However, some
features may require a newer kernel version. The associated Virtual Function
(VF) driver for this driver is iavf. The associated RDMA driver for this driver
is irdma.
.sp
Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ip. Instructions
on updating ethtool can be found in the section Additional Configurations later
in this document.
.sp
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not
supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the
drivers.
.sp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use
with Linux.
.sp
This driver supports XDP (Express Data Path) on kernel 4.14 and later and
AF_XDP zero\-copy on kernel 4.18 and later. Note that XDP is blocked for frame
sizes larger than 3KB.

.SH IMPORTANT NOTES
.SS TC0 must be enabled when setting up DCB on a switch
.sp
The kernel assumes that TC0 is available, and will disable Priority Flow
Control (PFC) on the device if TC0 is not available. To fix this, ensure TC0 is
enabled when setting up DCB on your switch.
.SS Enabling a VF link if the port is disconnected
.sp
If the physical function (PF) link is down, you can force link up (from the
host PF) on any virtual functions (VF) bound to the PF. Note that this requires
kernel support (Red Hat kernel 3.10.0\-327 or newer, upstream kernel 3.11.0 or
newer) and associated iproute2 user space support.
.sp
For example, to force link up on VF 0 bound to PF eth0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip link set eth0 vf 0 state enable
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
If the command does not work, it may not be supported by your system.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Do not unload port driver if VF with active VM is bound to it
.sp
Do not unload a port\(aqs driver if a Virtual Function (VF) with an active Virtual
Machine (VM) is bound to it. Doing so will cause the port to appear to hang.
Once the VM shuts down, or otherwise releases the VF, the command will complete.
.SS Configuring SR\-IOV for improved network security
.sp
In a virtualized environment, on Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapters that
support SR\-IOV or Intel(R) Scalable I/O Virtualization (Intel(R) Scalable IOV),
the virtual function (VF) may be subject to malicious behavior.
Software\-generated layer two frames, like IEEE 802.3x (link flow control), IEEE
802.1Qbb (priority based flow\-control), and others of this type, are not
expected and can throttle traffic between the host and the virtual switch,
reducing performance. To resolve this issue, and to ensure isolation from
unintended traffic streams, configure all SR\-IOV or Intel Scalable IOV enabled
ports for VLAN tagging from the administrative interface on the PF. This
configuration allows unexpected, and potentially malicious, frames to be
dropped.
.sp
See \fI\%Configuring VLAN Tagging on SR\-IOV Enabled Adapter Ports\fP later in this README for configuration
instructions.
.SS Firmware Recovery Mode
.sp
A device will enter Firmware Recovery mode if it detects a problem that
requires the firmware to be reprogrammed. When a device is in Firmware Recovery
mode it will not pass traffic or allow any configuration; you can only attempt
to recover the device\(aqs firmware. Refer to the Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters and
Devices User Guide for details on Firmware Recovery Mode and how to recover
from it.

libelf\-devel, elfutils\-libelf\-devel).
.IP \(bu 2
When compiling an out\-of\-tree driver, details will vary by distribution.
However, you will usually need a kernel\-devel RPM or some RPM that provides

.sp
.nf
.ft C
modprobe i40e [<option>=<VAL1>]

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There needs to be a \fB<VAL#>\fP for each network port in the system supported by
this driver. The values will be applied to each instance, in function order.
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modprobe i40e max_vfs=7
.ft P

.IP \(bu 2
The i40e driver only supports the \fBmax_vfs\fP kernel parameter on older
kernels that do not have the standard sysfs interface.
.IP \(bu 2
The only other module parameter supported is the \fBdebug\fP parameter that can
control the default logging verbosity of the driver.
.IP \(bu 2
In general, use ethtool and other OS\-specific commands to configure
user\-changeable parameters after the driver is loaded.
.IP \(bu 2
The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.
.UNINDENT
.SS max_vfs
.sp
This parameter adds support for SR\-IOV. It causes the driver to spawn up to
max_vfs worth of virtual functions.
.sp

This parameter is only used on kernel 3.7.x and below. On kernel 3.8.x
and above, use sysfs to enable VFs. Use sysfs for Red Hat distributions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, you can create 4 VFs as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo 4 > /sys/class/net/<ethX>/device/sriov_numvfs
.ft P
.fi

echo 0 > /sys/class/net/<ethX>/device/sriov_numvfs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The parameters for the driver are referenced by position. Thus, if you have a
dual port adapter, or more than one adapter in your system, and want N virtual
functions per port, you must specify a number for each port with each parameter
separated by a comma. For example, the following will spawn 4 VFs on the first
port:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modprobe i40e max_vfs=4
.ft P

.SS Configuring the Driver on Different Distributions
.sp
Configuring a network driver to load properly when the system is started is
distribution dependent. Typically, the configuration process involves adding an
alias line to \fB/etc/modules.conf\fP or \fB/etc/modprobe.conf\fP as well as editing
other system startup scripts and/or configuration files. Many popular Linux
distributions ship with tools to make these changes for you.
.sp
To learn the proper way to configure a network device for your system, refer to
your distribution documentation. If during this process you are asked for the
driver or module name, the name for the Base Driver is i40e.
.SS Displaying VF Statistics on the PF
.sp
Use the following command to display the statistics for all VFs on the PF:

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

For untrusted VFs, assigning a MAC address for a VF from the host
will disable any subsequent requests to change the MAC address from within
the VM. This is a security feature. The VM is not aware of this restriction,

.SS Trusted VFs and VF Promiscuous Mode
.sp
This feature allows you to designate a particular VF as trusted and allows that
trusted VF to request selective promiscuous mode on the Physical Function (PF).
.sp
To set a VF as trusted or untrusted, enter the following command in the

It\(aqs important to set the VF to trusted before setting promiscuous
mode. If the VM is not trusted, the PF will ignore promiscuous mode requests
from the VF. If the VM becomes trusted after the VF driver is loaded, you
must make a new request to set the VF to promiscuous.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Once the VF is designated as trusted, use the following commands in the VM to
set the VF to promiscuous mode.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For promiscuous all, use the following, where \fB<ethX>\fP is a VF interface

By default, the ethtool private flag \fBvf\-true\-promisc\-support\fP is

set the promiscuous mode for the VF to true promiscuous and allow the VF to
see all ingress traffic, use the following command:
.INDENT 0.0

The \fBvf\-true\-promisc\-support\fP private flag does not enable promiscuous mode;
rather, it designates which type of promiscuous mode (limited or true) you will
get when you enable promiscuous mode using the \fBip link\fP commands above. Note
that this is a global setting that affects the entire device. However, the
\fBvf\-true\-promisc\-support\fP private flag is only exposed to the first PF of the
device. The PF remains in limited promiscuous mode (unless it is in MFP mode)
regardless of the \fBvf\-true\-promisc\-support\fP setting.

Next, add a VLAN interface on the VF interface. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip link add link eth2 name eth2.100 type vlan id 100
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Note that the order in which you set the VF to promiscuous mode and add the
VLAN interface does not matter (you can do either first). The result in this
example is that the VF will get all traffic that is tagged with VLAN 100.
.SS Virtual Function (VF) Tx Rate Limit

Intel Ethernet Flow Director ATR is enabled by default when the kernel is in
multiple transmit queue mode. A rule is added when a TCP flow starts and is

ethtool (sideband). ATR is automatically re\-enabled when all TCP sideband rules
are deleted or when sideband is disabled.

.SS Filters to Direct Traffic to a Specific VF
.sp
It is possible to create filters that direct traffic to a specific Virtual
Function. For older versions of ethtool, this depends on the \fBaction\fP
parameter. Specify the action as a 64\-bit value, where the lower 32 bits
represent the queue number, while the next 8 bits represent the VF ID. Note
that 0 is the PF, so the VF identifier is offset by 1. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ethtool \-U <ethX> flow\-type tcp4 src\-ip 192.168.10.1 dst\-ip \e

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The action field specifies to direct traffic to Virtual Function 7 (8 minus 1)
into queue 2 of that VF.
.sp
Newer versions of ethtool (version 4.11 and later) use \fBvf\fP and \fBqueue\fP
parameters instead of the \fBaction\fP parameter. Note that using the new ethtool
\fBvf\fP parameter does not require the value to be offset by 1. This command is
equivalent to the above example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ethtool \-U <ethX> flow\-type tcp4 src\-ip 192.168.10.1 dst\-ip \e

.SS Flex Byte Intel Ethernet Flow Director Filters

would match TCP/IPv4 packets which have the value 0xBEAF 8 bytes into the
TCP/IPv4 payload.
.sp
Note that ICMP headers are parsed as 4 bytes of header and 4 bytes of payload.
Thus to match the first byte of the payload, you must actually add 4 bytes to
the offset. Also note that ip4 filters match both ICMP frames as well as raw
(unknown) ip4 frames, where the payload will be the L3 payload of the IP4 frame.
.sp
The maximum offset is 64. The hardware will only read up to 64 bytes of data
from the payload. The offset must be even because the flexible data is 2 bytes
long and must be aligned to byte 0 of the packet payload.
.sp
The user\-defined flexible offset is also considered part of the input set and
cannot be programmed separately for multiple filters of the same type. However,
the flexible data is not part of the input set and multiple filters may use the
same offset but match against different data.
.SS Cloud Filter Support
.sp
On a complex network that supports multiple types of traffic (such as for
storage as well as cloud), cloud filter support allows you to send one type of
traffic (for example, the storage traffic) to the Physical Function (PF) and
another type (say, the cloud traffic) to a Virtual Function (VF). Because cloud
networks are typically VXLAN/GENEVE\-based, you can define a cloud filter to
identify VXLAN/GENEVE packets and send them to a queue in the VF to be
processed by the virtual machine (VM). Similarly, other cloud filters can be
designed for various other traffic tunneling.

The kernel assumes that TC0 is available, and will disable Priority
Flow Control (PFC) on the device if TC0 is not available. To fix this,
ensure TC0 is enabled when setting up DCB on your switch.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
DCB is a configuration Quality of Service implementation in hardware. It uses
the VLAN priority tag (802.1p) to filter traffic. That means that there are 8
different priorities that traffic can be filtered into. It also enables
priority flow control (802.1Qbb) which can limit or eliminate the number of
dropped packets during network stress. Bandwidth can be allocated to each of
these priorities, which is enforced at the hardware level (802.1Qaz).
.sp
DCB is normally configured on the network using the DCBX protocol (802.1Qaz), a
specialization of LLDP (802.1AB). The i40e driver supports the following
mutually exclusive variants of DCBX support:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Firmware\-based LLDP Agent
.IP \(bu 2
Software\-based LLDP Agent
.UNINDENT
.sp
In firmware\-based mode, firmware intercepts all LLDP traffic and handles DCBX
negotiation transparently for the user. In this mode, the adapter operates in
\(dqwilling\(dq DCBX mode, receiving DCB settings from the link partner (typically a
switch). The local user can only query the negotiated DCB configuration. For
information on configuring DCBX parameters on a switch, please consult the
switch manufacturer\(aqs documentation.
.sp
In software\-based mode, LLDP traffic is forwarded to the network stack and user
space, where a software agent can handle it. In this mode, the adapter can
operate in either \(dqwilling\(dq or \(dqnonwilling\(dq DCBX mode and DCB configuration can
be both queried and set locally. This mode requires the FW\-based LLDP Agent to
be disabled.

.SS Linux bonding failures with VFs

If you bind Virtual Functions (VFs) to an Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series device,
the VF targets may fail when they become the active target. If the MAC address
of the VF is set by the PF (Physical Function) of the device, when you add a
target, or change the active\-backup target, Linux bonding tries to sync the
backup target\(aqs MAC address to the same MAC address as the active target. Linux
bonding will fail at this point. This issue will not occur if the VF\(aqs MAC
address is not set by the PF.

Executing the command \fBip link show\fP only shows MAC addresses if they are set
by the PF. Otherwise, it shows all zeros.
.sp
This is expected behavior. The PF driver is passing zeroes to the VF driver
that the VF driver can generate its own random MAC address and report it to the
guest OS. Without this feature, some guest operating systems will incorrectly
assign the VF a new interface name each time they reboot.
.SS IPv6/UDP checksum offload does not work on some older kernels
.sp
Some distributions with older kernels do not properly enable IPv6/UDP checksum
offload. To use IPv6 checksum offload, it may be necessary to upgrade to a
newer kernel.
.SS Driver Buffer Overflow Fix
.sp
The fix to resolve CVE\-2016\-8105, referenced in Intel SA\-00069
<\X'tty: link https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00069.html'\fI\%https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security\-center/advisory/intel\-sa\-00069.html\fP\X'tty: link'>,
is included in this and future versions of the driver.
.SS depmod warning messages about unknown symbol during installation
.sp
During driver installation, you may see depmod warning messages referring to
unknown symbols \fBi40e_register_client\fP and \fBi40e_unregister_client\fP\&. These
messages are informational only; no user action is required. The installation
should complete successfully.
.SS Error: \(dq<ethX> selects TX queue XX but real number of TX queues is YY\(dq
.sp
When configuring the number of queues under heavy traffic load, you may see an
error message stating \fB<ethX> selects TX queue XX, but real number of TX queues
is YY\fP\&. This message is informational only and does not affect functionality.
.SS Fixing Performance Issues When Using IOMMU in Virtualized Environments
.sp
The IOMMU feature of the processor prevents I/O devices from accessing memory
outside the boundaries set by the OS. It also allows devices to be directly
assigned to a Virtual Machine. However, IOMMU may affect performance, both in
latency (each DMA access by the device must be translated by the IOMMU) and in
CPU utilization (each buffer assigned to every device must be mapped in the
IOMMU).
.sp
If you experience significant performance issues with IOMMU, try using it in
\(dqpassthrough\(dq mode by adding the following to the kernel boot command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
intel_iommu=on iommu=pt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This mode enables remapping for assigning devices to VMs, providing
near\-native I/O performance, but does not provide the additional memory
protection.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Transmit hangs leading to no traffic
.sp
Disabling flow control while the device is under stress may cause tx hangs and
eventually lead to the device no longer passing traffic. You must reboot the
system to resolve this issue.
.SS Bad checksum counter incorrectly increments when using VXLAN
.sp
When passing non\-UDP traffic over a VXLAN interface, the \fBport.rx_csum_bad\fP
counter increments for the packets.
.SS Statistic counters reset when promiscuous mode is changed
.sp
Changing promiscuous mode triggers a reset of the physical function driver.
This will reset the statistic counters.
.SS MAC address of Virtual Function changes unexpectedly
.sp
If a Virtual Function\(aqs MAC address is not assigned in the host, then the VF
(virtual function) driver will use a random MAC address. This random MAC
address may change each time the VF driver is reloaded. You can assign a static
MAC address in the host machine. This static MAC address will survive a VF
driver reload.
.SS Changing the number of Rx or Tx queues with \fBethtool \-L\fP may cause a kernel panic
.sp
Changing the number of Rx or Tx queues with \fBethtool \-L\fP while traffic is
flowing and the interface is up may cause a kernel panic. Bring the interface
down first to avoid the issue. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip link set <ethX> down
ethtool \-L <ethX> combined 4
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Intel Ethernet Flow Director Sideband Logic adds duplicate filter
.sp
The Intel Ethernet Flow Director Sideband Logic adds a duplicate filter in the
software filter list if the location is not specified or the specified location
differs from the previous location but has the same filter criteria. In this
case, the second of the two filters that appear is the valid one in hardware
and it decides the filter action.
.SS Multiple Interfaces on Same Ethernet Broadcast Network
.sp
Due to the default ARP behavior on Linux, it is not possible to have one system
on two IP networks in the same Ethernet broadcast domain (non\-partitioned
switch) behave as expected. All Ethernet interfaces will respond to IP traffic
for any IP address assigned to the system. This results in unbalanced receive
traffic.
.sp
If you have multiple interfaces in a server, turn on ARP filtering by entering
the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This only works if your kernel\(aqs version is higher than 2.4.5.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This setting is not saved across reboots. The configuration change
can be made permanent by adding the following line to the file
\fB/etc/sysctl.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter = 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, you can install the interfaces in separate broadcast domains
(either in different switches or in a switch partitioned to VLANs).
.SS UDP Stress Test Dropped Packet Issue
.sp
Under small packet UDP stress with the i40e driver, the system may drop UDP
packets due to socket buffers being full. Setting the driver Intel Ethernet
Flow Control variables to the minimum may resolve the issue. You may also try
increasing the kernel\(aqs default buffer sizes by changing the values in
\fB/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default\fP and \fBrmem_max\fP\&.
.SS Unplugging Network Cable While \fBethtool \-p\fP Is Running
.sp
In kernel versions 2.6.32 and newer, unplugging the network cable while
\fBethtool \-p\fP is running will cause the system to become unresponsive to
keyboard commands, except for control\-alt\-delete. Restarting the system should
resolve the issue.
.SS Rx Page Allocation Errors
.sp
\(dqPage allocation failure. order:0\(dq errors may occur under stress with kernels
2.6.25 and newer. This is caused by the way the Linux kernel reports this
stressed condition.
.SS Lower than expected performance
.sp
Some PCIe x8 slots are actually configured as x4 slots. These slots have
insufficient bandwidth for full line rate with dual port and quad port devices.
In addition, if you put a PCIe v4.0 or v3.0\-capable adapter into a PCIe v2.x
slot, you cannot get full bandwidth. The driver detects this situation and
writes one of the following messages in the system log:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
PCI\-Express bandwidth available for this card is not sufficient for optimal
performance. For optimal performance a x8 PCI\-Express slot is required.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
PCI\-Express bandwidth available for this device may be insufficient for
optimal performance. Please move the device to a different PCI\-e link with
more lanes and/or higher transfer rate.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this error occurs, moving your adapter to a true PCIe v3.0 x8 slot will
resolve the issue.
.SS Fiber optics and auto\-negotiation
.sp
Modules based on 40GBASE\-SR4, 25GBASE\-SR, active optical cable (AOC), and
active copper cable (ACC) do not support auto\-negotiation per the IEEE
specification. To obtain link with these modules, you must turn off
auto\-negotiation on the link partner\(aqs switch ports.
.SS \fBethtool \-a\fP autonegotiate result may vary between drivers
.sp
For kernel versions 4.6 or higher, \fBethtool \-a\fP will show the advertised and
negotiated autoneg settings. For the i40e driver and kernel versions below 4.6,
ethtool will only report the negotiated link status.
.sp
The issue is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.
.SS Running \fBethtool \-t <ethX>\fP command causes break between PF and test client
.sp
When there are active VFs, \fBethtool \-t\fP performs a full diagnostic. In the
process, it resets itself and all attached VFs. The VF drivers encounter a
disruption but are able to recover.
.SS Unable to obtain DHCP lease on boot with Red Hat
.sp
In configurations where the auto\-negotiation process takes more than 5 seconds,
the boot script may fail with the following message:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<ethX>: failed. No link present. Check cable?
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This error may occur even though the presence of link can be confirmed using
\fBethtool <ethX>\fP\&. In this case, try setting \fBLINKDELAY=30\fP in
\fB/etc/sysconfig/network\-scripts/ifdfg\-<ethX>\fP\&.
.sp
The same issue can occur during a network boot (via PXE) on Red Hat
distributions that use the dracut script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Warning: No carrier detected on interface <ethX>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case add \fBrd.net.timeout.carrier=30\fP at the kernel command line.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Link time can vary. Adjust \fBLINKDELAY\fP value accordingly.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, you can use NetworkManager to configure the interfaces, which
avoids the set timeout. For configuration instructions of NetworkManager, refer
to the documentation provided by your distribution.
.SS Loading i40e driver in 3.2.x and newer kernels displays kernel tainted message
.sp
Due to recent kernel changes, loading an out of tree driver causes the kernel
to be tainted.
.SS Unexpected Issues when the device driver and DPDK share a device
.sp
Unexpected issues may result when an i40e device is in multi driver mode and
the kernel driver and DPDK driver are sharing the device. This is because
access to the global NIC resources is not synchronized between multiple
drivers. Any change to the global NIC configuration (writing to a global
register, setting global configuration by AQ, or changing switch modes) will
affect all ports and drivers on the device. Loading DPDK with the
\fBmulti\-driver\fP module parameter may mitigate some of the issues.
.SS RPM driver installation fails with dependency issues on upstream kernels
.sp
Building an RPM Package Manager (RPM) file when running a nonstock kernel on
SUSE* Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) causes the ksyms definitions to not match
the ones provided by the installed kernel RPM. This results in dependency
conflicts that prevent the RPM from compiling and installing.
.SS VLAN pruning doesn\(aqt work when traffic is sent from local system
.sp
VLAN tagged traffic sent from other VFs attached to a NIC can be seen on other
VFs. This is due to an issue with NIC settings and offload settings of VFs.
.sp
To work around this issue, disable Tx VLAN offload on VFs:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ethtool \-K <ethX> tx\-vlan\-offload off
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This does not affect egress traffic from the outside NIC.
.SS SR\-IOV virtual functions have identical MAC addresses
.sp
When you create multiple SR\-IOV virtual functions, the VFs may have identical
MAC addresses. Only one VF will pass traffic, and all traffic on other VFs with
identical MAC addresses will fail. This is related to the
\fBMACAddressPolicy=persistent\fP setting in
\fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP\&.
.sp
To resolve this issue, edit the \fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP
file and change the \fBMACAddressPolicy\fP line to \fBMACAddressPolicy=none\fP\&. For
more information, see the systemd.link man page.
.SS \(dqVF X failed opcode 24\(dq error message in dmesg on host
.sp
With a Microsoft Windows Server 2019 guest machine running on a Linux host, you
may see \fBVF <vf_number> failed opcode 24\fP error messages in dmesg on the host.
This error is benign and does not affect traffic. Installing the latest iavf
driver in the guest will resolve the issue.
.SS Windows guest OSs on a Linux host may not pass traffic across VLANs
.sp
The VF is not aware of the VLAN configuration if you use Load Balancing and
Failover (LBFO) to configure VLANs in a Windows guest. VLANs configured using
LBFO on a VF driver may result in failure to pass traffic.
